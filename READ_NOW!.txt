WINAMP PLUGIN IN VB
===================
VERSION 1.0.0
=============

Thanks
------
Thanks to Col Rjl and Nullsoft for the code and the Gen Wrapper DLL and
documentation!

Important Stuff
---------------
1)First in order to see the compiled version look in the
'Compiled' folder.
You will find the readme for the dlls in that folder.

2)Next if you want to see the code goto the 'Code' folder.
When you open the the project file VB might ask you for a type 
library. Browse to the 'Code' folder and find the GenWrapper.tlb file
and click OK.

3)If you want to create your own plugin you can use my example or
start from scratch by reading the template readme file in the 'Code'
folder.

System Requirements
-------------------
*Any Version of Winamp that supports plugins.
*Visual Basic 6 (for source code).
*Visual Basic 6 Runtimes (for compiled program).


Known Bugs
----------

Beta Testing
------------
Tested on Winamp 2.64 on both Windows 98SE and Windows 2000.
This plugin / source code should work with any version of Winamp that
supports plugins.
